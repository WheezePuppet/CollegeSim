\section{DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:discussion}

Clearly, there is a wealth of analysis to be done on this simulation, and we have barely even brushed the surface of the 
possibilities. In future analyses, we hope to collect data on more combinations of the parameters. We seek to determine how 
extreme a policy must be for it to effectively integrate the population for a variety of race weights. Obviously, the null 
weight for race displayed integration regardless of policy status. Other than that, we failed to achieve pure integration 
with any one other policy. It may be that the policies need be more severe, or that we must use the policies in 
conjunction. It also may be that the policies struggle at this proportion of minorities in the population, but would 
excel if the number of minorities was marginally increased. There are an innumerable number of questions to be posed 
surrounding this simulation, and an even wider expanse of data to be collected.
