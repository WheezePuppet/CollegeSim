We would like to thank Madeline Lord and Jessica White, University of Mary
Washington computer science alumnae, for their valuable contributions to this
project's ideas and implementation. We are also grateful to various UMW
administrators, particularly Dr. Leah Cox and the Office of Diversity and
Inclusion, for their valuable insights into the nature of student dynamics and
race relations which significantly influenced our modeling choices.
