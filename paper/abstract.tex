\section*{ABSTRACT}

Colleges worldwide have identified racial diversity as a vital dimension of
their educational experience. Institutions might increase their level of
diversity by addressing the problem of perceived social estrangement among
minorities: studies have shown that this is a chief factor in minority
retention. One approach to this problem is to deliberately construct social
groups for white and minority students to interact at the beginning of and
throughout their college experience. Such interactions aimed at reducing the
social segregation of the population may lead to lasting friendships between
students of different races, and then bear further fruit later as different
cultures and attitudes interact in positive ways. In this paper we describe an
agent-based simulation of a college student body in which students form dyadic
and group connections and change their preferences in response to their peers.
We report novel findings about the level of impact such a policy might have on
overall degree of segregation.
