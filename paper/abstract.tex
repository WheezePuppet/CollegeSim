\section*{ABSTRACT}

Colleges worldwide have identified racial diversity as a vital dimension of
their educational experience. Institutions might increase their level of
diversity by addressing the problem of perceived social estrangement among
minorities: studies have shown that this is an important factor in minority
retention. One approach is to deliberately construct integrated social groups
for students at the beginning of their college experience. These early
interactions, aimed at reducing the social segregation of the population, may
lead to lasting friendships between students of different races, and then bear
further fruit later as different cultures and attitudes interact in positive
ways. In this paper we describe an agent-based simulation of a college student
body in which students form dyadic and group connections and change their
preferences in response to their peers. We describe how the model can be used
to study the impact of institutional policies on overall degree of
segregation.
