	url = {http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED350894},
	abstract = {This journal issue discusses student attrition and the major recurring themes regarding students withdrawing from college. It is revealed that less than 15 percent of student departures are as a result of academic dismissal, with the remaining students leaving voluntarily, even when their academic performance is clearly acceptable. The following recurrent themes of student attrition are examined: (1) uncertainty both about what to expect from college and its rewards; (2) transition/adjustment problems; (3) financial difficulties; and (4) academic underpreparation. The extremely high attrition rates during the freshman year underscore the difficulties students face in making the adjustment to college life. Careerism may contribute to the stress of adjustment by forcing an early  decision about majors and careers. Integration into college life, particularly among minorities, is important for sustaining student commitment. However, minority students, particularly blacks, have difficulty with integration into a largely white environment; this may explain their lower persistence rates. Theories such as the college-fit model and Tinto's path analysis model help identify the factors that influence student persistence. These theories point to the selection process as one way to increase persistence, but such approaches may drive selection to a more homogeneous population rather than facilitating the adjustment of all students. (Contains 38 references.) A brief "Viewpoint" column (Carole Morning) addresses college attrition. (Contains 11 references.) (BLR)},

	abstract = {Abstract Models predicting ethnic minority and nonminority students' intentions to remain enrolled in college were tested for equivalence. On the basis of previous research, the predictors were coping with college, self-esteem, academic integration, identification with the university, and experience of disrespect because of race, ethnicity, or religion. Participants were 139 ethnic minority and 507 nonminority students at a U.S. university. Results indicate similarities and differences in the models for predicting commitment for ethnic minority and nonminority students. The relationship between academic achievement and commitment to remain in college was strong only for ethnic minority students. Identification with the university was positively related and experience of disrespect was negatively related to commitment for all students. When students perceived the environment as unwelcoming because of race, ethnicity, or religion, their desire to continue attending college diminished. Ethnic minority students were more likely than White students to report experiencing disrespect.},
