	abstract = {This journal issue discusses student attrition and the major recurring themes regarding students withdrawing from college. It is revealed that less than 15 percent of student departures are as a result of academic dismissal, with the remaining students leaving voluntarily, even when their academic performance is clearly acceptable. The following recurrent themes of student attrition are examined: (1) uncertainty both about what to expect from college and its rewards; (2) transition/adjustment problems; (3) financial difficulties; and (4) academic underpreparation. The extremely high attrition rates during the freshman year underscore the difficulties students face in making the adjustment to college life. Careerism may contribute to the stress of adjustment by forcing an early  decision about majors and careers. Integration into college life, particularly among minorities, is important for sustaining student commitment. However, minority students, particularly blacks, have difficulty with integration into a largely white environment; this may explain their lower persistence rates. Theories such as the college-fit model and Tinto's path analysis model help identify the factors that influence student persistence. These theories point to the selection process as one way to increase persistence, but such approaches may drive selection to a more homogeneous population rather than facilitating the adjustment of all students. (Contains 38 references.) A brief "Viewpoint" column (Carole Morning) addresses college attrition. (Contains 11 references.) (BLR)},

On the basis of previous research, the predictors were coping with college, self-esteem, academic integration, identification with the university, and experience of disrespect because of race, ethnicity, or religion. Participants were 139 ethnic minority and 507 nonminority students at a U.S. university. Results indicate similarities and differences in the models for predicting commitment for ethnic minority and nonminority students. The relationship between academic achievement and commitment to remain in college was strong only for ethnic minority students. Identification with the university was positively related and experience of disrespect was negatively related to commitment for all students. When students perceived the environment as unwelcoming because of race, ethnicity, or religion, their desire to continue attending college diminished. Ethnic minority students were more likely than White students to report experiencing disrespect.},

One group of students that we are trying to gain a better understanding of is “first-generation” students, those whose parents did not graduate from college. This article presents the results of a study that investigated longitudinal effects of being a first-generation student on attrition. Results indicated that first-generation students were more likely to depart than their counterparts over time. After controlling for factors such as race, gender, high school grade point average (GPA), and family income, the risk of attrition in the first year among first-generation students was 71\% higher than that of students with two college-educated parents.},

	abstract = {Understanding racial, ethnic, and immigrant variation in educational achievement and attainment is more important than ever as the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse. The Census Bureau estimates that in 2000, 34\% of all youth aged 15-19 were from minority groups; it estimates that by 2025, this will increase to 46\% (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). In addition, approximately one in five school-age children reside in an immigrant family (Zhou 1997, Suarez-Orozco \& Suarez-Orozco 2001). We provide an overview of recent empirical research on racial, ethnic, and immigrant differences in educational achievement and attainment, and we examine some current theories that attempt to explain these differences. We explore group differences in grades, test scores, course taking, and tracking, especially throughout secondary schooling, and then discuss variation in high school completion, transitions to college, and college completion. We also summarize key theoretical explanations used to explain persistent differences net of variation in socioeconomic status, which focus on family and cultural beliefs that stem from minority group and class experiences. Overall, there are many signs of optimism. Racial and ethnic gaps in educational achievement and attainment have narrowed over the past three decades by every measure available to social scientists. Educational aspirations are universally high for all racial and ethnic groups as most adolescents expect to go to college. However, substantial gaps remain, especially between less advantaged groups such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans and more advantaged groups such as whites and Asian Americans. The racial and ethnic hierarchy in educational achievement is apparent across varying measures of the academic experience.},

	abstract = {This study uses High School and Beyond third follow-up data to analyze college completion rates for graduates of high schools located in the country's largest metropolitan areas. First, it examines the effects of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on degree attainment prospects. Next, three high school characteristics--high school type (public or private), high school location within the metropolitan area (city or suburb), and high school racial composition--and two academic measures (high school grades and scores on a standardized test) are introduced in order to see whether these measures account for race and SES differences. Finally, three stages of completing college--application, entry for those who apply, and graduation for those who enter--are analyzed separately in an attempt to pinpoint when the determinants of degree completion have their impact. The findings indicate that differences attributable to SES and high school racial composition persist, with low-SES individuals and those from high schools with lower percentages of whites experiencing lower graduation rates, even when students' postsecondary educational plans, academic ability, and college entry are controlled. Most students who desire to obtain a college degree are at least able to apply to college and attend some classes. However, once in college, persisting to graduation proves more problematic.},
