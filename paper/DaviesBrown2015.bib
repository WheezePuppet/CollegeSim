This paper investigates how local preferences and social structural constraints might affect the development of the friendship network in Facebook. We do this by analyzing a dataset of an American university, Caltech, and by building an agent-based simulation for comparison. Several different, but plausible, processes of friendship network development are proposed in which the structural information of the growing network and the student preferences are taken into account. 'Network formation based on personal preference and social structure' matches the data best, and is thus the preferred hypothesis for the way that students add "friends" on Facebook.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size.},

	doi = {10.1017/nws.2014.17},
	abstract = {Homophily—the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others—is one of the most persistent findings in social network analysis. Its importance is established along the lines of a multitude of sociologically relevant dimensions, e.g. sex, ethnicity and social class. Existing research, however, mostly focuses on one dimension at a time. But people are inherently multidimensional, have many attributes and are members of multiple groups. In this article, we explore such multidimensionality further in the context of network dynamics. Are friendship ties increasingly likely to emerge and persist when individuals have an increasing number of attributes in common? We analyze eleven friendship networks of adolescents, draw on stochastic actor-oriented network models and focus on the interaction of established homophily effects. Our results indicate that main effects for homophily on various dimensions are positive. At the same time, the interaction of these homophily effects is negative. There seems to be a diminishing effect for having more than one attribute in common. We conclude that studies of homophily and friendship formation need to address such multidimensionality further.},

	abstract = {Studies of cultural differentiation have shown that social mechanisms that normally lead to cultural convergence-homophily and influence-can also explain how distinct cultural groups can form. However, this emergent cultural diversity has proven to be unstable in the face of cultural drift-small errors or innovations that allow cultures to change from within. The authors develop a model of cultural differentiation that combines the traditional mechanisms of homophily and influence with a third mechanism of network homophily, in which network structure co-evolves with cultural interaction. Results show that in certain regions of the parameter space, these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead to patterns of cultural diversity that are stable in the presence of cultural drift. The authors address the implications of these findings for understanding the stability of cultural diversity in the face of increasing technological trends toward globalization.

	abstract = {Models of segregation dynamics have examined how individual preferences over neighborhood racial composition determine macroscopic patterns of segregation. Many fewer models have considered the role of household preferences over other location attributes, which may compete with preferences over racial composition. We hypothesize that household preferences over location characteristics other than racial composition affect segregation dynamics in nonlinear ways and that, for a critical range of parameter values, these competing preferences can qualitatively affect segregation outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we develop a dynamic agent-based model that examines macro-level patterns of segregation as the result of interdependent household location choices. The model incorporates household preferences over multiple neighborhood features, some of which are endogenous to residential location patterns, and allows for income heterogeneity across races and among households of the same race. Preliminary findings indicate that patterns of segregation can emerge even when individuals are wholly indifferent to neighborhood racial composition, due to competing preferences over neighborhood density. Further, the model shows a strong tendency to concentrate affluent families in a small number of suburbs, potentially mimicking recent empirical findings on favored quarters in metropolitan areas.

Our findings temper and in some instances contradict Laurie and Jaggi's claim that expanding ‘vision’, the size of the immediate neighbourhood households consider when evaluating residential ethnic mix, makes stable integration a likely outcome in Schelling-like models with weak-to-moderate preferences. We note several reasons why our results differ from Laurie and Jaggi's. The most important of these is that Laurie and Jaggi underestimate the segregation-producing potential of weak-to-moderate preferences because they overlook a powerful interaction between preferences and ethnic demography and perform their simulations using the optimal ethnic mix for achieving integration. We show that the preferences Laurie and Jaggi describe as compatible with stable integration generate high levels of segregation in their model under settings for ethnic demography common in real cities.

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

Substantial evidence indicates that our social networks are divided into tiers in which people have a few very close social support group, a larger set of friends, and a much larger number of relatively distant acquaintances. Because homophily--the principle that like seeks like--has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model--the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared--can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {This journal issue discusses student attrition and the major recurring themes regarding students withdrawing from college. It is revealed that less than 15 percent of student departures are as a result of academic dismissal, with the remaining students leaving voluntarily, even when their academic performance is clearly acceptable. The following recurrent themes of student attrition are examined: (1) uncertainty both about what to expect from college and its rewards; (2) transition/adjustment problems; (3) financial difficulties; and (4) academic underpreparation. The extremely high attrition rates during the freshman year underscore the difficulties students face in making the adjustment to college life. Careerism may contribute to the stress of adjustment by forcing an early  decision about majors and careers. Integration into college life, particularly among minorities, is important for sustaining student commitment. However, minority students, particularly blacks, have difficulty with integration into a largely white environment; this may explain their lower persistence rates. Theories such as the college-fit model and Tinto's path analysis model help identify the factors that influence student persistence. These theories point to the selection process as one way to increase persistence, but such approaches may drive selection to a more homogeneous population rather than facilitating the adjustment of all students. (Contains 38 references.) A brief "Viewpoint" column (Carole Morning) addresses college attrition. (Contains 11 references.) (BLR)},

	abstract = {No dimension in American society has divided people more than race in general, and in particular, the division between blacks and whites. The saliency of this issue remains strong despite certain gains. With impending demographic shifts over the next 50 years, and continued reliance on colleges and universities to develop leaders for our county, understanding the role of racial attitudes and segregation patterns on our campuses becomes more important.
This study is an application of the Schelling model for residential segregation to the residents of a large, state university in the Southeast. Data on student preferences for the racial composition of their residence hall are collected and used to test a proposition in Schelling's model, namely, that dissatisfied residents are more likely to request reassignment. More specifically, the study examines movement and preference at the level of an entire residence hall as well as at the individual level. In addition, the racial composition of each residence hall and its "desirability", as viewed through students' rankings of the halls for the next year's housing assignment are related to expressed preferences. Further analyses are conducted to see if expressed student preferences for the racial composition of their residence hall are related to a variety of other attitudinal attributes that may be influencing the preferences. The aim is to account for observed trends in racial segregation.
Results find minimal support for the hypothesis that preferences, in light of actual building composition, leads to movement. Large and significant differences, however, are found in the expressed preferences for the racial composition of a residence hall between black and white students. In addition, several attitudinal and demographic measures were found to be related to the students' expressed preferences for the racial composition of their residence hall. Specifically, students with more socially and politically liberal attitudes expressed more tolerant preferences within race and gender subgroups.},

These hypotheses are tested with data on 304 face-to-face groups from 10 communities. We find that friends are more similar on status dimensions than chance and that this homophily is produced both by the restricted opportunity structure offered by the group and by homophilous choices made within the group. Organizational heterogeneity leads to substantially greater dyadic status distance within the organization, while organization size consistently reduces dyadic status distance. At a given level of diversity, a larger group will permit more homophilous friendship pairing. However, correlated status dimensions create little reduction in dyadic social distance. In general, homogeneity within groups is the overwhelming determinant of homophily.},

Schelling describes a variety of mechanisms that facilitate the partitioning of populations into readily discernable groups. Among Schelling's most important observations regard the influence of individual choices. This study builds on those insights in an examination of uncoordinated individual settlement preferences; and how, when taken in the aggregate, they form clearly segregated residential patterns. This study also examines an element of Schelling's work, that segregation is reinforced by the practices of organizations. In particular, individual choices may be reinforced by formal social control as represented by the influence of policing practices. Following the minority threat perspective as exemplified by Blalock (1967), this study examines how evolving coalitions respond to and are effected both by organizing trends and formal social controls. Rather than relying on observational data such as Census or UCR reports, this study seeks to understand the phenomena of segregation and reinforcement through the use of computer simulation modeling. In using computer models, this research is able to ally many of the problems often associated with research in this area.},

	abstract = {Abstract Models predicting ethnic minority and nonminority students' intentions to remain enrolled in college were tested for equivalence. On the basis of previous research, the predictors were coping with college, self-esteem, academic integration, identification with the university, and experience of disrespect because of race, ethnicity, or religion. Participants were 139 ethnic minority and 507 nonminority students at a U.S. university. Results indicate similarities and differences in the models for predicting commitment for ethnic minority and nonminority students. The relationship between academic achievement and commitment to remain in college was strong only for ethnic minority students. Identification with the university was positively related and experience of disrespect was negatively related to commitment for all students. When students perceived the environment as unwelcoming because of race, ethnicity, or religion, their desire to continue attending college diminished. Ethnic minority students were more likely than White students to report experiencing disrespect.},

	abstract = {Residential segregation between blacks and whites remains high even after many years of fair housing legislation. This dissertation combines recently developed techniques in evolutionary game theory and agent-based simulation to study the dynamics of residential segregation.
After an introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 gives a brief literature review. We then, in Chapter 3, argue that racial income disparity is not able to account for the observed high level of segregation. First, blacks and whites who earn the same income are found to be highly segregated. Second, the level of segregation that can be sustained solely by income disparity is significantly below the actual level of observed segregation.
Chapter 4 introduces a variation of the Schelling model that incorporates economic variables, and whose dynamics can be rigorously analyzed. Extensive survey data has shown that most whites prefer to live close to other whites, while blacks are not as demanding for like-color neighbors. We show that generally this is enough to generate residential segregation as individuals move in response to their environments. Agent-based simulation is employed to illustrate the evolutionary dynamics of such a process. The asymmetric setting of the model has an interesting implication for housing prices and vacancies, for which there is some empirical evidence.
Chapter 5 extends Schelling's original "Checkerboard model." In studying housing segregation, researchers find that many individuals do not mind living in mixed-race neighborhoods. In fact, as the General Social Survey revealed, a majority of blacks and a fair number of whites prefer half-black, half-white neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are, however, rarely found in urban America. Following Schelling's pioneering work, we construct an evolutionary model of residential choice and characterize its long-run dynamic properties. It shows that, even when every agent prefers to live in a half black, half-white neighborhood, the society will end up in a segregated pattern in the long run. The model puts on a rigorous footing Schelling's insight that segregation is persistent not necessarily because people like it, but due to the fact that people dislike to be isolated in a neighborhood of different color. The last chapter summarizes the main findings.},
