    I'll start, and talk through slides 1-5.

    You talk through slides 6-11, then switch to Firefox, which will have the
web sim loaded up. Press "Run Sim" and watch it go. Click on the tabs just to
show the wowza graphics and look impressive, without feeling the need to talk
through each of them exhaustively. Maybe pick one or two graphs on one or two
tabs that you like the best, and briefly articulate what they're showing. You
could modify a couple parameters (actually clicking on the policies to expose
the hidden slider bars would be nice) and run it a second time.

    Then it transitions back to me, and I'll finish the talk, including
results and next steps. Then Q&A.


    Note: I like progressively revealing the contents of slides as I talk
through the points. Some people don't like that -- they like the entire slide
to appear as soon as it comes up. If you're like me, feel free to sprinkle
"\pause" lines throughout your slides at the desired places, as you see I've
done. If you're not like me, then just ignore this note and yours will all
come up at once.
